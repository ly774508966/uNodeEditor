# uNodeEditor
Generic Node Editor for Unity Projects. Inspired by https://github.com/Seneral/Node_Editor

This is a work in progress, encouraged by the fact that I could not do what I wanted with Seneral Node Editor, but still liked the idea and design. No affiliation with the original. Feel free to use it, no licence.
